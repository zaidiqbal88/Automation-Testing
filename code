 1) Test Successful Login with Valid Credentials:
describe('Login Page', () => {
  it('should allow a user to log in with valid credentials', () => {
    // Perform login with valid credentials
    // For example, fill in username and password fields, and click the login button
    // You should use your specific testing framework and WebDriver commands here
    
    // Assert that the user is redirected to the dashboard
    // You might need to check the current URL or some element on the dashboard page
    // For example, using WebDriver's .getCurrentUrl() or .getText() methods
    
    // Example using Chai assertion library
    expect(currentUrl).to.equal('dashboard-url');
  });
});
2) Test Unsuccessful Login Attempts with Invalid Credentials:
describe('Login Page', () => {
  it('should show an error message for unsuccessful login attempts with invalid credentials', () => {
    // Perform login with invalid credentials
    // For example, fill in username and password fields with incorrect data and click the login button
    
    // Assert that an error message is displayed on the login page
    // You can use WebDriver to locate the error message element
    
    // Example using Chai assertion library
    expect(errorMessageElement.getText()).to.equal('Invalid username or password');
  });
});

3) Validate that Appropriate Error Messages are Displayed for Invalid Login Attempts:

This test is essentially an extension of the second test case, where you're checking for specific error messages.

4) On Successful Login, Validate that the User is Redirected to the Dashboard Screen:

This is also included in the first test case. After performing a successful login, we should assert that the user is redirected to the dashboard by checking the current URL or some element on the dashboard page.
